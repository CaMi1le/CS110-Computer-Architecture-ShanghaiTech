Do you think "one line comment for every four lines" really reasonable? Comments is a good programming habit indeed, and I used to understand that we should have 25% of our code to be comments. But after I checked your scripts, I'm shocked to find comments are required to be almost uniformly distributed in our code, basically four code lines following one line comment. Does this requirement really make sense?
We're not a beginner yet, comments only play an auxiliary role while coding. Don't you think these crazy requirements go too formalistic? Comments are born for proper usage. When I'm checking my code, I even find it may turn out to be so ridiculous to insert comments into some certain lines, just for passing that comment checker! Suppose I have a code block of 5 lines, but I have to insert an ugly comments before the last line, owe to the principle of comments, which makes both code and comments unreadable.
Again, comments are nice, but checking code in this rigid way seems unreasonable. Scripts are supposed be applied in a proper way, like checking the elf header or symbol table. Since TAs still need to review our code,
